          <p>HTML (HyperText Markup Language) is the code that is used to structure a web page and its content. For
            example, content
            could be structured within a set of paragraphs, a list of bulleted points, or using images and data tables.

          <img src="image/css.webp" alt="html-img" width="250px">
          <p>CSS is the acronym of “Cascading Style Sheets”. CSS is a computer language for laying out and structuring
            web pages (HTML or XML). This language contains coding elements and is composed of these “cascading style
            sheets” which are equally called CSS files</p>

          <p>JavaScript is a scripting language used to develop web pages. Developed in Netscape, JS allows developers
            to create a dynamic and interactive web page to interact with visitors and execute complex actions. It also
            enables users to load content into a document without reloading the entire page</p>

          <p>The Digital Signature Algorithm (DSA) is a public-key cryptosystem and Federal Information Processing
            Standard for digital signatures, based on the mathematical concept of modular exponentiation and the

          <p>Java is a multi-platform, object-oriented, and network-centric language that can be used as a platform in
            itself. It is a fast, secure, reliable programming language for coding everything from mobile apps and
            enterprise software to big data applications and server-side technologies.</p>

          <p>Python is commonly used for developing websites and software, task automation, data analysis, and data
            visualisation. Since it's relatively easy to learn, Python has been adopted by many non-programmers, such as
            accountants and scientists, for a variety of everyday tasks, like organising finances.</p>
